            <h5 class="card-title">About Me</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Hello, I am Vinson here is a little about me. I am a twenty-four-year-old currently
                enrolled in the UCF Full Stack Coding Boot Camp. I decided to join this program after Corona virus
                pandemic caused me to get furloughed from Penske Auto Motive Company. When I got furloughed it was an
                eye-opening experience for me, kind of showing me the career path I was on was not that stable. Ive
                always had interest in computers and how the work. I built my first PC myself when I was in middle
                school only getting help by watching YouTube videos. Ive been building my own computers and computers
                for friends and family ever since. A former co-worker of mine left and took a similar course and after
                talking to him while on furlough it really piqued my interest in a career switch. Which inevitable lead
                to me to submitting my two weeks' notice and signing up for this course.

                However, in my free time I spend lots of time with my cars. I currently own rare spec BMW E46 M3 and an
                older BMW E36 M3. The E46 is my street car but the E36 is a full racecar, its interior has been
                completely stripped out weight and the stock BMW engine was taken out and swapped with a Toyota Supra
                motor making 650 horsepower. I spend almost all my free time with friends working on my cars or theirs
                or at race track breaking the cars were fixing. </p>
